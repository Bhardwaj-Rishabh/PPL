# Infinite PCFG

Task considered: Learninng PCFGs-To learn the number of non-terminal symbols, production rules, and associated probabilities.

 ## Using HDP
 
 ```
- Non-parametric bayes, where, the number of parameters are not fixed beforehand and grows with data.
- Hyracrhical Dirichlet Process
```
